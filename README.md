# handbrake

Powershell script for converting multiple video files using handbrake.
GUI was initially set up using poshgui.com

Handbrakecli.exe needs to be at "C:\handbrake\handbrakecli.exe"

Script creates an XML file at "c:\users\\<userprofile>\handbrakeconfig.xml"
All this does is save the Handbrake Config options so it doesn't have to be retyped every time the program is loaded.

For best experience, use PS2EXE to turn this script into an executable.
